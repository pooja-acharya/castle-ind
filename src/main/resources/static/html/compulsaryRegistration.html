				Technology (DeitY) initiated Compulsory Registration Scheme (CRS)
				through a gazetted order during end of 2012 and brought in 15
				product categories under this mandatory compliance scheme. Bureau of
				Indian Standards (BIS) was the implementation agency. Market
				surveillance is implemented by DeitY on its own and has appointed
				different companies for picking samples according to its
				instructions.</p>
			<br />
			<p class="lead">Under this program of CRO, it is mandatory for
				the manufacturers of these products to get a Mandatory Registration
				Number from BIS and affix a Self Declaration Statement on the
